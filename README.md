# Student Mental Health: Early Depression Risk Detection

A **two-component intelligent system** that combines **Association Rule Mining** with **Machine Learning** to detect early signs of depression among university students, paired with a production-ready **Django web application** for real-time survey collection and risk prediction.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project helps universities and mental health professionals identify students at risk of depression **early and interpretably**.

### Two Main Components:

1. **Offline ML Research Pipeline**

   * Discovers meaningful association rules using a **custom Apriori algorithm**
   * Generates interpretable binary rule-based features
   * Trains and evaluates **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models on enriched features
   * Produces **14 high-quality visualizations** and analysis artifacts

2. **Django Web Application**

   * Public student survey interface
   * Admin dashboard with analytics and response management
   * Real-time depression risk prediction using the trained model
   * Results visible only to administrators (students see a thank-you message)

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **Python** 3.14
* **Django** 6.0.3
* **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, SHAP
* **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, networkx
* **Others**: joblib, shortuuid, SQLite (development)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ankush-Shukla/Student_Mental_Health.git
cd Student_Mental_Health

# Using uv (recommended) or pip
uv sync
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the ML Pipeline

```bash
python pipeline.py --data data/raw/train.csv --output outputs/
```

**Key Flags:**

* `--support 0.05` — Minimum support threshold
* `--confidence 0.60` — Minimum confidence threshold
* `--lift 1.10` — Minimum lift threshold
* `--sample 5000` — Sample rows for faster iteration

### 3. Run the Django Web App

```bash
cd StudentMentalHealth
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

Access at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

* Public survey: `/surveys/`
* Admin login → Admin Dashboard

---

## 📊 What the Pipeline Generates

* `association_rules.csv`, `depression_rules.csv`
* `features_enriched.csv` (with Rule_000, Rule_001... features)
* Trained models: `lr.pkl`, `rf.pkl`
* `bin_encoders.pkl` + `feature_template.csv` (required for inference)
* 14 publication-quality visualizations (150 DPI, dark theme)
* SHAP summary plot
* Model performance metrics (`metrics.json`)

---

## 🔍 Key Features

### Interpretability-First Approach

* Custom Apriori algorithm (pure Python + NumPy, no mlxtend)
* Strong association rules converted into binary features
* Enhances model transparency and explainability

### Robust Preprocessing

* Handles survey data quirks (quote artefacts, "?" sentinels, etc.)
* Thoughtful binning strategies for Age, CGPA, Pressure, Sleep, etc.
* Consistent feature engineering between pipeline and inference

### Production-Ready Inference

* `core/inference.py` mirrors preprocessing used during training
* Persisted LabelEncoders ensure correct categorical encoding at inference
* Rule features computed using exact item-set matching

### Beautiful Admin Dashboard

* Real-time analytics with Chart.js
* Response tracking and risk statistics
* Printable reports with conic-gradient visuals

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
pytest tests/
```

* Covers preprocessing, Apriori logic, transaction building, and inference.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Notes

* `student_detail` view currently has no authentication guard (publicly accessible by ID)
* `mlxtend` is listed but not used (leftover dependency)
* Financial stress stored as `CharField` due to "?" values in raw data
* Result page uses session-based data (only accessible immediately after submission)
